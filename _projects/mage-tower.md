## Story

In a realm where the material and intangible intertwine, the fabric of existence weaves together both wondrous magic and harrowing blight. Within the hallowed halls of an ancient Mage Tower, a sacred sanctuary tainted by the malevolence that emanates from its spire, your path unfolds. Leading a small yet formidable squad, your mission is to ascend the tower's treacherous levels, confronting the grand mage believed to be the source of this corruption.

Embark on a perilous quest where the lines between good and evil blur, where the pursuit of truth intertwines with the pursuit of power. Will you uncover the secrets that lie hidden within the tower's depths, or will you succumb to the unforeseen trials that await?

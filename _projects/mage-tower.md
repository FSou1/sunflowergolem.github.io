## Story

The material plane has become entwined with the intangible, giving rise to both: wonders of magic and horrors of blight. An ancient magic tower is a sacred place, but the source of the blight is right at its spire, corrupting everything around. Guiding your small but skilled squad you should make it through all the levels to the very top of the tower and defeat the grand mage.

Or, at least, that's what you think.

## Gameplay

Player's resourses are limited, and they will have to make difficult choises, trying not only to overcome but even to make it through alive.

As it is shown in the video, the full gameplay time is about 15-20 minutes.

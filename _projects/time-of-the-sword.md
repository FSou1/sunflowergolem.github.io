This project is still in process.

For centuries, the battle between good and evil has raged on, with the world's fate hanging on the blade of a sword. Through it all, the ancient heroes have stood vigilant, guarding the realm from harm.

Yet, the line between good and evil blurs, a rift emerges not only amidst the realms, but among the bogatyrs. Finist has to confront his own beliefs and seek out the truth that could save the world from certain doom.

![image-left](/assets/images/photo.png){: .align-left} Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

My name is Taisiia, and I'm a narrative designer and game screenwriter. There's nothing I love more than crafting immersive, interactive stories that take players on a journey to fresh and exhilarating realms where they can experience something new and exciting. For me, the thrill of creating these stories and watching players get lost in them is the ultimate reward.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on a range of different and amazing projects throughout my career, including the popular home decor mobile game "Design Masters" by Playgendary and the gripping detective story "Sunset Secrets" by Dou Dou Games. Currently, I'm working on an exciting new challenge - an AAA action adventure game called "Time of the Sword" with Alpha Games Studio. In this project, I am responsible for crafting not only the game's plot and characters but also its world and lore based on Slavic folklore.

But my love for storytelling doesn't stop with my work projects. My passion drives me to explore different mediums. Currently, I'm working on a personal project - a visual novel in the psychological thriller genre called "Mage Tower". I’m also an avid tabletop role-playing gamer and have been designing my own D&D campaign “An average adventure” that takes place in a homebrew world. Through this, I've honed my storytelling and world-building skills and have learned how to create engaging quests, encounters, and mechanics that keep players on their toes.

In addition to my work in game development, I also write articles about narrative design and game storytelling. I also write and translate articles for GoodGame.ru, a leading cyber-sports and game news portal. I even have my own column about board games, which I play often as a hobby.

I’m happy to meet new creative people and share my hot passions for games and storytelling. So whether you're a fellow writer, gamer, or just someone who loves a good tale, I invite you to join me on this journey.

[The Lust for Loot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9nMnLeatADSpB9KkArmdb89thCBmAlF6iluN_JXf3Q/edit?usp=sharing) - a choice-based interactive romance game writing sample in a fantasy setting. It shows game writerâ€™s work with short diamond shape choice trees and high priority for animation economy and laconic texts.

Adele, a daring young woman thief, infiltrates a princess's room to pilfer her jewels, but her plans are upended when she becomes captivated by a golden bracelet adorned with a dragon. She puts it on only to be surprised by a man named Draco, who toys with Adele's desires.

What does Adele want more: to get out of the danger or to surrender to her lust for loot?

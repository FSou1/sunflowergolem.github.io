[Guiding Star](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1by1x5B6gLjfkFEUwQ9z96Yz7iCu8OZ9TWf9YDDlMUys/edit?usp=sharing) is a just-so story about creation of the main navigational constellation in a dark fantasy setting. It shows the game writerâ€™s work on deep lore that makes the fictional world feel more alive and believable for players.

The Mikara people faced a threat from The Big Bad Bug. Desperate to escape its wrath, some villagers ventured into the dark forest to find a new place to live, but they never returned. The remaining villagers cleaned the land, hoping to find their lost loved ones, but to no avail. The great shaman asked Mother Earth and Father Sky for help, and they gave their children a way to always find their way home.
